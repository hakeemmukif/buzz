//! Observer-frame retention prune worker (v4).
//!
//! Deletes archived kind-24200 observer-frame rows older than the configured
//! window (`observer_retention_days`, from `archive_meta`). Every other
//! archived kind — NIP-AM metrics (44200) and any custom subscription kind — is
//! kept indefinitely and never touched here (Will's v4 ruling, 2026-08-19).
//!
//! # Scheduling
//!
//! No cron. The worker is triggered opportunistically — once shortly after
//! archive sync starts, and again after each archive commit — and gated two
//! ways so those frequent triggers collapse into at most one real prune per
//! day:
//!
//! 1. **In-process single-flight** ([`super::ArchiveDb::try_prune_guard`]): a
//!    `compare_exchange` on an `AtomicBool` admits exactly one prune at a time
//!    in this process; a trigger that arrives while a prune is running is
//!    dropped, not queued. This is a single-process desktop app, so an
//!    in-process flag is sufficient — no lease or fenced token (the v3 design's
//!    fenced prune lease was cut in v4).
//! 2. **≥24h timestamp gate** (`archive_meta.prune_last_success_at`): a prune
//!    that finds the last success within 24h returns immediately. The timestamp
//!    is written after every clean pass (even one that deleted nothing), so a
//!    burst of post-commit triggers costs one meta read apiece, not a scan.
//!
//! A prune failure is fully detached from the archive commit that triggered it:
//! [`trigger_prune`] spawns onto the async runtime and swallows the result, so a
//! prune error can never fail a user's archive write.
//!
//! # Delete discipline
//!
//! Candidate scope-row primary keys are materialized inside each batch
//! transaction and fixed for that transaction (Thufir's binding condition #4):
//! the batch deletes exactly those rows, then runs a **candidate-scoped** orphan
//! GC over only the event ids it just unscoped — never a widened whole-table
//! anti-join (`store::gc_orphaned_events` stays a rare repair pass, not the
//! normal path) and never a post-delete re-scan to discover new orphans. The GC
//! cascades BOTH derived indexes, `observer_channel_index` (the one the
//! whole-scan GC does not cover) and `agent_metric_index`, so no index row
//! outlives the canonical event it was derived from.
